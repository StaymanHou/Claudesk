# m5-wp5-pip-toggle-lifecycle-autosummon — 2026-06-27

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit f6e3929; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 2 MAJOR / 2 MINOR.)*

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP5-PIPMODE-STATE-DUP-PER-WORKSPACE
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `RightPanelHost.tsx:136-159` — the `pipMode` state + `pip_get_mode` fetch + `pip-mode` listener are duplicated per RightPanelHost instance (one per mounted workspace), so at N workspaces there are N redundant IPC fetches + N subscriptions for one app-global value. The inline comment acknowledges it's "fine per-RightPanelHost," but it's avoidable at the N>1 the milestone targets.
- **Fix shape:** lift `pipMode` to App-level state (fetched + subscribed once), passed down as a prop — mirroring how `tiles` is derived once in App. Low effort.
- **Priority:** low.
- **Status:** pending — DEFERRED at debt-paydown WP4 (operator, 2026-06-30), anchored to **M9**. The per-`RightPanelHost` `pip-mode` subscription is the project's INTENDED "all surfaces subscribe to the same backend broadcast" pattern (PiP mode is already an app-global View-menu radio, backend = single source of truth via `pip_set_mode`/`pip_get_mode` + the `pip-mode` event), not a missing-app-state bug — the only real cost is N-1 redundant `pip_get_mode` mount fetches. M9's time-tracking toggle follows the same backend-command + `*-mode`-broadcast + per-consumer-subscribe shape, so there is no shared app-settings store to build once-vs-twice. Fold the dedup into M9's settings work IF an app-settings hook materializes there; else it stays the documented pattern.

# qol-wp1-close-workspace — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `c01a3f9`. Reviewer rated the feature well-built and idiomatic — the standout being the per-pane `cc_kill`-on-unmount that reaps both PTY panes generically and closes a latent WP7 lifecycle gap. All findings are low-risk: two over-narrated comments + one accepted test-boundary gap. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP1-APP-WIRING-UNTESTED
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/Filmstrip.tsx`, `src/App.tsx` (requestClose / resolveClose / dirty-probe registry)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** test-coverage gap
- **Finding:** Only the pure layer (reducer, `dirtyDocCount`, `closeWorkspaceSpec`) is unit-covered. No component test for the × (stopPropagation routing, keyboard Enter/Space) and no App-level test for the probe-registry / focus-repick wiring. Accepted boundary per the project's manual-host-UI convention + the live 9/9 operator verification — but the App wiring (`requestClose` reading the `workspaces` closure, `resolveClose` clearing `pendingClose`) is the part most likely to regress silently.
- **Pickup shape:** if/when the project adopts a component-test harness (RTL) or E2E (deferred per Phase-1 convention), add a Filmstrip-×-routing test + an App close-handler test. Low value until then; dismiss if the manual-verification posture holds.

# app-menu-bar — 2026-06-24

1 MAJOR + 2 MINOR from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `f815154` (0 CRITICAL). Reviewer rated the feature well-built, appropriately-scoped, adds zero new behavior, integrates through existing chord predicates. The MAJOR is the one real durability concern: an unguarded cross-language id contract. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-APPMENU-LISTENER-NOT-EXTRACTED
- **Files:** `src/App.tsx:120-160` (the `menu` listener effect)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** testability (consistent with standing posture)
- **Finding:** The `menu` listener body (id→action mapping, key re-dispatch, the 4 callback branches with the focused-path-ref lookup) lives inline in `App()` — the one piece of menu logic not extracted to a pure testable seam (unlike `menuBridge`). Extracting the action-dispatch (given an action + a small effects object) would let the callback-vs-key branching be unit-tested. LOW priority — consistent with the repo's "runtime-bound listeners are not unit-tested" posture (XtermPane, useWorkspaceStatus); the pure `menuBridge` mapping IS fully tested, which is the higher-value half.
- **Pickup shape:** optional extraction of a pure `dispatchMenuAction(action, effects)` + its unit test. Defer unless the listener grows.

# m3-wp2-hook-install — 2026-06-22

4 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `77d6a6e` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated it well-built and defensively-minded for a dangerous operation (mutating a shared user `settings.json`); standout test suite (real-config shape + byte-exact round-trip + never-wipe-on-parse-failure). No refactor warranted; all cosmetic/opportunistic. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP2-MINORS
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/hook_install/commands.rs:42` + `mod.rs:78`; `src-tauri/resources/claudesk-hook.pl:66`; `src-tauri/src/hook_install/mod.rs:101`; `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:62`
- **Priority:** low (all)
- **Status:** PARTIAL — #2 (Perl write-side blocking) RESOLVED (the WP3 listener drains promptly) and #4 (stale `sublime_open` "removed at WP8" comment) RESOLVED 2026-06-30 (debt-paydown WP5): the `lib.rs` `sublime_open` registration comment now states the WP8-redefinition permanent-escape-hatch reality (in-app editor primary, Sublime Text stays one-click, `⌘⇧O` dropped) instead of "Transitional — removed at WP8." #1 (chmod/invocation mismatch — a behavior decision) + #3 (`NotAnObject` error-variant coarseness — an error-enum refactor) remain as genuine deferrables.
- **Findings:**
  1. **chmod/`/usr/bin/perl` mismatch** — the registered command runs `/usr/bin/perl <script>` (not `<script>` directly), so the `chmod 0o755` in `deploy_hook_script` + the script's shebang are never exercised; the `commands.rs`/`mod.rs:78` comment "CC invokes it directly" is inaccurate. Either drop the chmod (dead effort) or invoke the script directly. *(Mild — keeping chmod is harmless future-proofing if the command form ever changes; pick one and reconcile the comment.)* **— PARTIALLY ADDRESSED 2026-06-22 (commit 99a48d5):** the related "shell-form is fine, paths are app-controlled" assumption was the leading edge of a real word-split bug (spaced app-data path) — now fixed (paths shell-quoted). The chmod-vs-invocation cosmetic mismatch itself remains open (low pri).
  3. **`NotAnObject` error-variant coarseness** — three distinct shape failures (root not object, `hooks` not object, an event value not an array) all collapse to one variant (`mod.rs:101`); a malformed `hooks.<event>` array value yields the misleading "root is not a JSON object" message. Opaque-string-to-toast, low impact; a future debugger would be misdirected.
- **Pickup shape:** both remaining nits are quick opportunistic `/feature-refactor` fixes. Dismiss any via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.

# m2-wp2-editor-shell — 2026-06-19

2 MAJOR + 3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `a84f3e9` (0 CRITICAL). Feature rated "advances the codebase rather than accruing debt." Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot (MAJOR → Case B, MINOR → low). The two MAJORs are the load-bearing ones (backend root-trust seam + a doc/behavior security-invariant mismatch), both flagged as Phase-2-hardening candidates, neither refactor-blocking.

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-RESOLVE-WITHIN-LEAF-SYMLINK
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/editor_fs/mod.rs:45-90` (`resolve_within`)
- **Finding:** Canonicalizes only the target's *parent* and re-attaches the leaf un-canonicalized; a symlink whose *leaf* points outside the workspace root is NOT rejected (read/write follow it), yet the module doc (lines 17-22, 50-52) claims "a symlink inside root pointing outside is also rejected." Doc overclaims an invariant the code doesn't fully enforce.
- **Why it matters:** A future reader trusts "invariant not convention" and won't re-audit. Low exploitability (single-user local tool, user picks in-project files) but the doc/behavior mismatch is the debt.
- **Suggested action:** Canonicalize the resolved target when it exists and re-check `starts_with(root_canon)`; OR downgrade the doc claim to match. Pairs with the Phase-2 backend-hardening item below.
- **Priority:** medium
- **Status:** PARTIAL (D2, debt-paydown WP5, operator decision 2026-06-30) — DOC downgraded now, HARDENING deferred. The `editor_fs` module header + `resolve_within` doc were narrowed to state the actual guarantee: a non-leaf (directory-component) symlink escaping root IS rejected (parent canonicalize), but a LEAF symlink is NOT followed-and-validated; the over-claim is gone. The actual fix (canonicalize the full target when it exists) stays **Deferred** to a future hardening pass (anchored here), NOT done this sweep.

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-BACKEND-TRUSTS-FRONTEND-ROOT
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/editor_fs/commands.rs:18-26` (`read_file`/`write_file`)
- **Finding:** Both commands take `root: String` straight from the frontend with no app-side derivation, unlike `config_store`'s commands which resolve `app_data_dir()` server-side. The "confined to the open project" guarantee rests entirely on the renderer passing a correct `projectPath` — the trust boundary for the root guard lives in the webview, not the backend.
- **Why it matters:** Phase 2 (multi-workspace) multiplies the IPC callers and surface; this is the seam to tighten before more callers depend on it. Acceptable for the single-user PoC today.
- **Suggested action:** Consider having the backend validate `root` against the known project list (config_store) before honoring it, so a malformed/hostile root can't widen the guard. Pairs with the leaf-symlink item above (same module, same Phase-2 hardening pass).
- **Priority:** medium
- **Status:** PARTIAL (D2, debt-paydown WP5, operator decision 2026-06-30) — DOC stated now, HARDENING deferred. The `editor_fs/commands.rs` module doc now explicitly says `root` is frontend-supplied/-trusted (not re-validated against config_store) — acceptable for the single-user local editor where the frontend shares the trust boundary; the guard's job is to confine the *file path* to `root`, not authenticate `root`. The actual validate-`root`-against-config_store hardening stays **Deferred** to a future pass (anchored here, pairs with the leaf-symlink item above).

# file-op-error-surface (Deferred — net-new UX) — 2026-06-30

## SURFACE-2026-06-30-FILE-OP-ERROR-SURFACE
- **Severity:** MINOR (deferred — net-new UX, not debt)
- **Finding:** Right-panel file operations fail silently: a failed `delete_file` (WP5), a failed folder `trash_path` (WP5b), and a create that collides with a gitignored file like `.env` (WP5, silent overwrite) are all swallowed to `console.error` with no user-visible surface. RightPanelHost has NO toast/inline-error component — the existing code comments already say "a future toast could show it" / "would be new UX — intentionally [deferred]".
- **Why deferred (operator ruling, debt-paydown sweep #2, 2026-06-30):** building the error surface is net-new UX, not a debt sweep — it needs a toast/inline-error component in RightPanelHost that does not exist. Honor the recorded "intentionally deferred" intent. The three original findings (WP5-DELETE-FAILURE-NOT-SURFACED, WP5B-TRASH-FAILURE-NOT-SURFACED, WP5-CREATE-COLLISION-GITIGNORE) collapse into this one anchor — one error-surface feature closes all three.
- **Anchor:** a future error-surface feature (whenever RightPanelHost gains a toast/inline-error affordance).
- **Status:** DEFERRED (anchored — net-new UX)
