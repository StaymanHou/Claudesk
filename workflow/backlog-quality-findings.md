# Backlog — Code-Quality Findings

This file collects findings surfaced by `feature-review-quality` between ship and finalize. Each entry is grouped under a `# <feature-name> — <YYYY-MM-DD>` header. A single pointer per feature is added to `workflow/backlog.md`.

To pick up: read the entries below, then run `/feature-refactor` to address them. To dismiss: edit the originating WIP file's `## Code-Quality Review` section and mark the line `[DISMISSED]`.

# m8-wp3-filmstrip-demo — 2026-06-29

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit a42ba61; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 3 MINOR. Reviewer: "well-built, well-scoped dev tooling that does exactly what its plan said and no more... advances the codebase (reusable cursor/keycap tracks WP4's PiP demo can lean on) rather than accruing debt; the only debt is cosmetic comment/data drift." Nothing rises to a refactor trigger for author-controlled, gitignored-output, dev-only marketing tooling.)*

## SURFACE-2026-06-29-QUALITY-M8WP3-EVAL-CLASSIC-SCRIPT-IN-TEST
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Location:** `tooling/demo/timeline.filmstrip.nodetest.mjs:31` (loads the timeline via `eval(readFileSync(...))` against a bare `window` shim).
- **Finding:** The only viable read path for a non-module classic script, and well-commented — but `eval` of file contents is brittle if the timeline ever gains a reference the shim doesn't provide (e.g. `document`). On-record only; not worth changing while the timeline stays data-only.
- **Suggested action:** None now. If the timeline ever references browser globals beyond `window`, extend the shim. Dismiss-candidate.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m7-menu-bar-status-item — 2026-06-29

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 3888dd6; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 3 MINOR. Reviewer: "well-built, appropriately-scoped... reuses every existing seam, no new dependency/webview/broadcaster change... advances the codebase without accruing debt." All 3 are comment/duplication nits, none backlog-worthy beyond MINOR.)*

## SURFACE-2026-06-29-QUALITY-M7-TRAY-ID-MATCH-DUP
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Location:** `src-tauri/src/tray/commands.rs:147-150` (`handle_tray_menu_event`) vs `src-tauri/src/tray/mod.rs` (`is_tray_menu_id`).
- **Finding:** `handle_tray_menu_event` re-matches the two tray ids that `is_tray_menu_id` already validated, with a `_ => return false` arm commented "unreachable given the predicate." The tray id set is thus duplicated across two functions; a 3rd tray actuator needs both edited in lockstep.
- **Suggested action:** Optional — a single `match id` returning bool (no separate predicate) would remove the duplication; or leave as-is (the predicate is unit-tested, the dead arm keeps the match total). Defensible either way.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-29-QUALITY-M7-TRAY-ID-UNUSED-LOOKUP
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Location:** `src-tauri/src/tray/commands.rs:54` (`TRAY_ID`).
- **Finding:** `TRAY_ID` ("claudesk-tray") is passed to `TrayIconBuilder::with_id`, but nothing looks the tray up by that id (the handle is stashed in `TrayState.icon`). Harmless; a one-line note that it exists for future `get_by_id` reachability would clarify intent.
- **Suggested action:** Add a one-line comment, or leave (good hygiene for future lookup). Cosmetic.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m6-wp11-multiple-right-panel-terminals — 2026-06-28

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit f9e3292; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 3 MINOR. Reviewer: "well-built... the only debt is minor — a small logic duplication between the button handlers and the keydown branches that a shared callback would erase. Nothing here warrants a refactor pass.")*

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP11-ENTRY-ID-SESSIONID-ALWAYS-EQUAL
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Location:** `src/components/workspace/terminalList.ts` — `TerminalEntry { id; sessionId }`.
- **Finding:** `id` and `sessionId` are kept as distinct fields "so a future rename/label can diverge," but in v1 they are always set equal (`{ id: sid, sessionId: sid }` at every construction site). A speculative-generality seam carried into the data model before the feature that needs it; cheap + documented, so borderline — noted only because always-equal fields invite a reader to wonder whether they can drift today (they can't).
- **Suggested action:** Either collapse to one field until a rename/label feature lands, or add a one-line note that they're intentionally always-equal in v1. Or leave as-is (the seam is cheap).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m6-wp10-right-panel-terminal-zoom — 2026-06-28

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit baaaa4c; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 2 MINOR — both cosmetic clarity/traceability nits. Reviewer: "well-built, tightly-scoped... only nits are cosmetic comment-clarity + a bundled-but-tracked eslint tweak; neither warrants a refactor pass.")*

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP10-SHARED-KEY-LAG-COMMENT
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `Workspace.tsx:158-182` — the shared-key zoom applies the new size only to the *focused* pane; an already-mounted background terminal re-seeds on next mount/refit. Intended + benign for the single-foreground use case, but the comment frames re-seed as "on its next mount/refit" without noting a *persistently mounted* background terminal will visibly lag until something forces a refit.
- **Fix shape:** one-line caveat in the `applyTerminalZoom` comment ("a persistently-mounted background terminal lags until its next refit"). No behavior change.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP10-ESLINT-IGNORE-BUNDLED
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `eslint.config.js:18-21` — the `tmp/**` + `src-tauri/tmp/**` ignore addition is an in-scope incidental fix bundled into the feature commit. Correctly commented + flagged in the WIP Build notes, so tracked not silent. Noted for traceability only; not a defect.
- **Fix shape:** none required (informational). If a future cleanup wants strict commit-atomicity, scratch-repo lint-ignore config could move to its own commit — not worth a dedicated pass.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m6-wp7-no-yolo-setting — 2026-06-28

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 4db7b82; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 3 MINOR — all clarity/consistency nits the existing pip-mode pattern already shares. Reviewer: "well-built, low-risk polish... accrues no meaningful debt; no refactor warranted.")*

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP7-MENU-WRITE-FAILURE-SILENT
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** The two `cc_set_yolo` write paths handle a rejection inconsistently: the picker (`ProjectPicker.tsx` `handleToggleYolo`) does optimistic-flip + revert + error toast; the App.tsx menu-listener path only `console.error`s with no user-visible signal. On a menu-path persist failure the checkmark (driven by the `cc-yolo` broadcast that never fires) silently diverges from reality until the next successful toggle. Pattern-consistent with the existing PiP-mode menu path (also silent) — not a regression vs the established pattern.
- **Fix shape:** either surface the menu-path failure (harder — App.tsx has no toast surface like the picker) OR add a one-line comment noting menu-path write failures are deliberately silent (mirrors pip_set_mode). Lean: the comment, unless a toast surface is added app-wide.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP7-DOUBLE-CC-YOLO-SUBSCRIBE
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** Two independent `cc-yolo` listeners are mounted — App.tsx's `ccYoloRef` effect + the picker's `setCcYolo` effect — each with its own `cc_get_yolo` seed call. Harmless (the picker only mounts on the picker screen; the ref-tracker lives at App root; the ref-vs-state split is deliberate) but reads as accidental duplication absent a note.
- **Fix shape:** a one-line comment on each effect noting the deliberate double-subscribe (ref for the menu-listener's invert-current; state for the picker's visible checkbox).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# wp6-filetree-shows-ignored-files — 2026-06-28

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 61db3d4; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 1 MAJOR / 3 MINOR. The MAJOR is a load-bearing-but-trivial cleanup — remove the now-dead `ignore` crate; the MINORs are doc/cosmetic. Reviewer: "well-built; the only follow-up is removing the now-unused dependency.")*

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP6-SYMLINK-SKIP-UNDOCUMENTED
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `walk_project` (`src-tauri/src/fs_index/mod.rs` ~202) skips symlinks (the un-traversed `file_type` is neither `is_dir()` nor `is_file()`) — correct + cycle-safe, but this visibility exclusion is documented only as an inline aside, not in the function/module doc that enumerates the contract (where `.git` + heavy-dir exclusions ARE spelled out). A symlinked source dir an operator edits would be silently invisible to tree/finder/search.
- **Fix shape:** add a one-line bullet to the `walk_project` / module "Exclusion model" doc naming the symlink skip alongside `.git` + heavy dirs.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP6-DETECTED-BIG-SYSCALL-COST
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `dir_is_heavy` (`src-tauri/src/fs_index/mod.rs` ~147) does a `read_dir` on every non-name-matched directory during the tree walk (the detected-big check), doubling directory-open syscalls vs. the walk's own. Acceptable for the single-user target + short-circuited at threshold+1, but the per-dir cost isn't called out next to the threshold constant.
- **Fix shape:** add a one-line cost note next to `HEAVY_DIR_CHILD_THRESHOLD` documenting the per-dir `read_dir` (short-circuited).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP6-DOC-WRAP-NIT
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** A reflowed doc-comment line in `project_search::search_core` (`src-tauri/src/project_search/mod.rs` ~172) runs slightly long past the file's otherwise-consistent wrap width. Cosmetic.
- **Fix shape:** re-wrap the line.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m6-wp5-editor-wrap-toggle — 2026-06-27

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 16ce60a; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 3 MINOR. All low-risk readability/factoring/copy notes — reviewer: "no refactor warranted; backlog-or-dismiss material.")*

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP5-DUAL-RECONFIGURE-PATH
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `EditorPanel.tsx` `onToggleWrap` (~110-118) duplicates the live compartment-reconfigure dispatch that `coreKeymap.applyWrap` already performs, AND the extensions memo (deps include `lineWrap`) rebuilds on the resulting state change — so a button click triggers two reconfigure paths (imperative dispatch + memo rebuild). Idempotent/harmless, but two call sites for one effect is a latent drift seam.
- **Fix shape:** route the button through the same `applyWrap` keymap entry, OR rely solely on the memo rebuild (pure-state toggle) so there's one reconfigure path. Leave-as-is is also defensible (the imperative dispatch avoids a render-cycle delay).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP5-CLOSED-OVER-FLAG-INVARIANT
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** The `Mod-\` `run` (editorExtensions.ts ~160-169) closes over `lineWrap` from the latest `buildEditorExtensions` call; correctness depends on the memo rebuilding (and @uiw reconfiguring the keymap) on every `lineWrap` change. The deps array is correct, but the load-bearing invariant is only lightly documented inline.
- **Fix shape:** add a one-line note that this relies on the memo's `lineWrap` dep, to harden against a future deps-array edit. (Identical mechanism to the fontSize chord — same latent fragility, same cheap mitigation.)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP5-TITLE-STATE-VS-ACTION
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** The wrap toggle's `title` reads "Soft-wrap on (⌘\)" when wrap is currently ON — a state label, while `aria-pressed` already conveys state and the click toggles. Slight affordance ambiguity (is the tooltip the current state or what the click does?). Cosmetic copy nit.
- **Fix shape:** either accept as-is (state-label tooltips are common) or reword to describe the action ("Toggle soft-wrap (⌘\)"). Trivial.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# wp4-terminal-font-zoom — 2026-06-27

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 67c3f54; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 2 MINOR. Both reviewer-flagged as "not a defect / not a finding to act on" — forward-looking readability/factoring notes only.)*

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP4-UNUSED-STATE-VALUE-BINDING
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `Workspace.tsx` `const [, setTerminalFontSize] = useState<number>(loadTerminalFontSize)` keeps a state cell whose VALUE binding is intentionally unused — only the setter is read, inside `applyTerminalZoom`'s functional updater (the batch-safe prior-size source). The empty destructure + the "value never drives a render" shape can puzzle a future maintainer.
- **Fix shape:** either leave as-is (the functional-updater read is genuinely the cleanest batch-safe pattern; the in-code comment already justifies it) OR swap to a `useRef` updated inside the same updater body for the same prior-value semantics without an unused state slot. Reviewer called it a defensible tradeoff, not a defect.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m5-wp5-pip-toggle-lifecycle-autosummon — 2026-06-27

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit f6e3929; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 2 MAJOR / 2 MINOR.)*

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP5-PIPMODE-STATE-DUP-PER-WORKSPACE
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `RightPanelHost.tsx:136-159` — the `pipMode` state + `pip_get_mode` fetch + `pip-mode` listener are duplicated per RightPanelHost instance (one per mounted workspace), so at N workspaces there are N redundant IPC fetches + N subscriptions for one app-global value. The inline comment acknowledges it's "fine per-RightPanelHost," but it's avoidable at the N>1 the milestone targets.
- **Fix shape:** lift `pipMode` to App-level state (fetched + subscribed once), passed down as a prop — mirroring how `tiles` is derived once in App. Low effort.
- **Priority:** low.
- **Status:** pending — DEFERRED at debt-paydown WP4 (operator, 2026-06-30), anchored to **M9**. The per-`RightPanelHost` `pip-mode` subscription is the project's INTENDED "all surfaces subscribe to the same backend broadcast" pattern (PiP mode is already an app-global View-menu radio, backend = single source of truth via `pip_set_mode`/`pip_get_mode` + the `pip-mode` event), not a missing-app-state bug — the only real cost is N-1 redundant `pip_get_mode` mount fetches. M9's time-tracking toggle follows the same backend-command + `*-mode`-broadcast + per-consumer-subscribe shape, so there is no shared app-settings store to build once-vs-twice. Fold the dedup into M9's settings work IF an app-settings hook materializes there; else it stays the documented pattern.

# qol-wp8-diff-viewer-polish — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `7385a61`. Reviewer verdict: well-built, tightly-scoped, right mechanism (measured CSS var + ResizeObserver), no debt accrued; no finding warrants a refactor pass. Priority: low (all). Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP8-REDUNDANT-COLLAPSE-DEP
- **Finding:** The sticky-var ResizeObserver effect lists `commitsCollapsed` in its dep array, but the observer already tracks the `.diff-commits` parent's height directly (only `.diff-commits-body` mounts/unmounts inside the observed node), so the re-run on collapse is belt-and-suspenders, not load-bearing. The inline comment slightly overstates that collapse needs the re-attach. The genuinely-needed deps are `view.kind` (banner appears/disappears) + `list.kind`/`commitDiff` (files area mounts).
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/diff/DiffPanel.tsx` sticky-var effect (~290-292).
- **Fix shape:** either drop `commitsCollapsed` from the deps (the observer covers it) OR keep it and reword the comment to mark it belt-and-suspenders so a future trimmer doesn't mistake it for load-bearing. Lowest-risk = comment reword.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP8-COMMENT-COPYEDIT-SLIP
- **Finding:** The `.diff-commits` comment reads "at the top:0 of .diff-scroll" — the inserted "the" is a copy-edit slip ("at top:0 of" or "at the top of" was intended).
- **Where:** `src/App.css` `.diff-commits` comment (~1726).
- **Fix shape:** one-word comment fix.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP8-FALLBACK-COUPLING
- **Finding:** The CSS first-paint fallback `--diff-commits-h: 2rem` is coupled to today's `.diff-commits-header` padding/font (≈2rem total); if those change later, the pre-observer first-paint offset drifts until the ResizeObserver fires. Harmless (observer corrects within a frame) but undocumented coupling.
- **Where:** `src/App.css` `.diff-scroll` `--diff-commits-h` default (~1714) ↔ `.diff-commits-header`.
- **Fix shape:** add a one-line comment cross-referencing `.diff-commits-header`'s height so the `2rem` guess's provenance is pinned.
- **Priority:** low

# qol-wp7-filetree-git-bubble-up — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `4d384b1`. Reviewer verdict: well-built, right architecture, no debt accrued; no finding warrants a refactor pass. Priority: low (all). Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP7-FORIN-NO-HASOWNPROPERTY
- **Finding:** `dominantStatusByDir` iterates `gitStatus` with `for (const path in gitStatus)` without a `hasOwnProperty` guard. Safe for the serde-serialized backend record, but an unexpected prototype key would inject a bogus dir.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/filetree/gitRollup.ts` `dominantStatusByDir` (~78).
- **Fix shape:** switch to `for (const path of Object.keys(gitStatus))` — removes the latent footgun at zero cost.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP7-CONSIDER-ARRAY-ALLOC
- **Finding:** the `consider` closure allocates a 1–2-element array per ancestor purely to reuse `dominantStatus`. Cosmetic given the input is changed-paths-only (O(changed × depth)).
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/filetree/gitRollup.ts` `consider` closure (~79).
- **Fix shape:** a direct precedence-index compare would avoid the per-step array, but the current form favors single-source-of-precedence clarity — defensible as-is; dismiss-candidate.
- **Priority:** low

# qol-wp5b-editor-folder-depth — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `374f7cb`. Reviewer verdict: well-built, security-conscious, ship-quality; no finding warrants a refactor pass. Priority: low (all). Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5B-TRASH-FAILURE-NOT-SURFACED
- **Finding:** a failed `trash_path` in `onDeleteFolderConfirm` is swallowed to `console.error` only — the tree isn't refreshed and no user-visible surface reports it, so the folder silently appears to still exist. Consistent with the single-file delete's existing behavior (and the WIP flags a future toast), but the folder-delete blast radius makes the silent-failure window more consequential.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/RightPanelHost.tsx` `onDeleteFolderConfirm` (~410).
- **Fix shape:** surface the trash failure inline/toast (reuse the new-file inline-error pattern). Pairs with the WP5 `SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5-DELETE-FAILURE-NOT-SURFACED` toast item — one fix covers both delete paths.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5B-GUARD-PARITY-COMMENT
- **Finding:** `validateRelSegments` rejects a leading `~` on the whole string, but the backend `resolve_within_lexical` has no `~` notion (treats `~` as a normal segment) — the two guards disagree on `~` (frontend stricter → safe, backend still contains under root). The "mirrors the backend lexical guard" comment slightly overstates parity.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/filetree/newFilePath.ts` `validateRelSegments` (~70).
- **Fix shape:** reword the comment to "stricter than / defense-in-depth over the backend guard" (or drop the `~`-whole-string check, since the backend contains it anyway). Cosmetic comment-accuracy.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5B-DESCENDANT-COUNT-STALE
- **Finding:** the folder-delete confirm's descendant `count` (`countDescendants` over the loaded `fs_tree` entries) reflects the tree as last refreshed; if the folder grew on disk since the last `fsTreeRefreshKey` bump, the displayed number understates the blast radius. The trash itself is correct (backend trashes the live subtree) — only the advisory number can lag.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/editor/confirmDialog.ts` `deleteFolderSpec` consumer in `RightPanelHost.tsx` (count source).
- **Fix shape:** accept as cosmetic (the WP0 watcher keeps the tree fresh in practice), or re-walk on confirm-open for an exact count. Lowest value of the three.
- **Priority:** low

# qol-wp5-editor-file-management — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `3abfe59`. Reviewer verdict: well-built, low-debt; no finding warrants a refactor pass. Priority: low (all). Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5-CREATE-COLLISION-GITIGNORE
- **Finding:** `createFile`'s collision check (`collides` over the `fs_tree` path set) can't see `.gitignore`d files — `fs_tree` excludes them via `ignore::WalkBuilder`. A new root-level name colliding with a gitignored file (e.g. `.env`) passes the guard and `write_file` overwrites it silently. `newFilePath.ts`'s `collides` doc ("turns create into create-new, don't clobber") is slightly overstated.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/RightPanelHost.tsx` `createFile` (~285-300) + the `collides` doc in `src/components/workspace/filetree/newFilePath.ts`.
- **Fix shape:** a pre-write `stat_file` existence check (truthy → reject; covers gitignored + untracked alike), OR a one-line doc caveat that the guard only covers tree-visible files. Low likelihood (v1 creates at root only); data is never outside the workspace.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5-DELETE-FAILURE-NOT-SURFACED
- **Finding:** `onDeleteConfirm` surfaces a failed `delete_file` only via `console.error` (the inline comment itself flags "a future toast could show it"). Every other failure path in the feature surfaces visibly (create errors render inline; fs_tree errors render a row). A delete that fails (e.g. permission) leaves the tree unchanged with no user-visible signal — the operator can't distinguish a no-op cancel from a silent failure.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/RightPanelHost.tsx` `onDeleteConfirm` (~320-327).
- **Fix shape:** surface the delete error inline (a transient row/toast near the tree, or reuse the inline-error pattern the new-file input already has). Consistent with the feature's surfaced-not-swallowed discipline.
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP5-NEWFILE-BLUR-DISCARDS
- **Finding:** the new-file input's `onBlur={cancelNewFile}` silently discards a partially-typed name on any focus-steal (clicking elsewhere in the rail). Enter-submit is safe (keydown precedes blur), but blur-cancels-silently is an undocumented UX choice.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/filetree/FileTree.tsx` the new-file input (~165).
- **Fix shape:** either a one-line comment marking blur-cancel as deliberate, or keep the input open on blur (cancel only on Esc). Cosmetic.
- **Priority:** low

# qol-wp4-terminal-respawn-on-switch — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `10c604f`. Reviewer rated the fix well-built and appropriately-scoped — the `active`-in-deps conflation was split cleanly into a pure `shouldSpawnOnActive` predicate + a tiny `[active, bridge.phase]` trigger effect + the single-source-of-truth `spawnTriggerDeps` contract; "change advances rather than accrues debt" for a file with a documented spawn-lifecycle bug history. All three findings are polish; none warrants a refactor pass. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP4-TRIGGER-ONCE-UNDERFLAGGED
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/XtermPane.tsx` (the deferred-spawn trigger effect, ~lines 418-425; cross-refs the spawn effect's `hasSpawnedRef.current = true` at ~line 365)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (comment accuracy / future-edit safety)
- **Finding:** The trigger effect reads non-reactive `hasSpawnedRef.current` while keyed on `[active, bridge.phase]`. A narrow async window exists after the nonce bump but before the latch is set where an `active` toggle could fire a second nonce bump. It is SAFE — the spawn effect's per-run `cancelled` closure self-kills the orphan so exactly one session survives — but the trigger effect's comment ("bumps `spawnNonce` exactly once") slightly overstates the guarantee; once-ness is co-enforced downstream by `cancelled`.
- **Pickup shape:** add a one-line comment at the trigger effect pointing at the `cancelled` backstop (so a future reader doesn't "tighten" the de-dup here and break the StrictMode contract). Comment-only; no behavior change.

# qol-wp3-switch-workspace-autofocus-cc — 2026-06-25

2 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `78c76d6`. Reviewer rated the feature well-built and tightly-scoped — minimal correct seam (imperative `focus()`-only handle → single `visible`-edge effect consolidating all four promote triggers), focus-only invariant designed-in AND test-pinned, no debt. Both findings are polish; neither warrants a refactor pass. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP3-OVERBROAD-NEWLINE-GUARD
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/__tests__/autofocusCcOnPromote.test.ts` (the `not.toMatch(/\r\n|\r|\n/)` assertion, ~line 63)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (test robustness)
- **Finding:** The no-PTY-byte guard pins the absence of any `\r`/`\n` escape anywhere in Workspace.tsx, not specifically in the focus path. Passes today (zero matches), but it's over-broad — a future unrelated `\n` literal (a tooltip string, a multiline template) would fail this test with a misleading "WP4 spurious-prompt regression" message. The companion `cc_input` assertion is appropriately targeted.
- **Pickup shape:** scope the assertion to the focus effect or to `invoke(`/PTY-write identifiers instead of the whole file. One small test edit. Dismiss if the broad guard is judged acceptable.

# qol-wp1-close-workspace — 2026-06-25

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `c01a3f9`. Reviewer rated the feature well-built and idiomatic — the standout being the per-pane `cc_kill`-on-unmount that reaps both PTY panes generically and closes a latent WP7 lifecycle gap. All findings are low-risk: two over-narrated comments + one accepted test-boundary gap. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP1-OVERNARRATED-X-COMMENT
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/Filmstrip.tsx` (expanded × ~252-280 + collapsed-pill × ~308-340)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (comment clarity)
- **Finding:** The × button comment narrates a rejected "invalid nested `<button>`" alternative before stating the actual `<span role="button">` choice — a future reader scanning it may think there's a nested-button bug. Trim to state only what shipped (and why span-over-button: to avoid invalid nesting inside the tile/pill button).
- **Pickup shape:** one-line comment edit at both × sites. Dismiss if the historical context is judged useful.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP1-DOCSREF-FORWARD-REF-COMMENT
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/editor/EditorSplit.tsx:137-141`
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (comment drift risk)
- **Finding:** The "(A live `docsRef` mirror of `docs` already exists below — reused by…)" comment forward-references the `docsRef` declared ~50 lines down (line ~188), restating a relationship the `docsRef.current` read at the handle already makes obvious. Drifts if the file is reordered.
- **Pickup shape:** delete the forward-referencing comment (or move it adjacent to the actual `docsRef` declaration). Trivial.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP1-APP-WIRING-UNTESTED
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/Filmstrip.tsx`, `src/App.tsx` (requestClose / resolveClose / dirty-probe registry)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** test-coverage gap
- **Finding:** Only the pure layer (reducer, `dirtyDocCount`, `closeWorkspaceSpec`) is unit-covered. No component test for the × (stopPropagation routing, keyboard Enter/Space) and no App-level test for the probe-registry / focus-repick wiring. Accepted boundary per the project's manual-host-UI convention + the live 9/9 operator verification — but the App wiring (`requestClose` reading the `workspaces` closure, `resolveClose` clearing `pendingClose`) is the part most likely to regress silently.
- **Pickup shape:** if/when the project adopts a component-test harness (RTL) or E2E (deferred per Phase-1 convention), add a Filmstrip-×-routing test + an App close-handler test. Low value until then; dismiss if the manual-verification posture holds.

# qol-wp0-fs-watcher — 2026-06-24

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `d893254`. Reviewer rated the feature well-built, advancing the codebase — a textbook instance of the repo's conventions (status_broadcaster split, reused `ignore`/`diskConflict` seams, lifecycle through the existing register/deregister diff loop, IPC snake_case pinned both sides). All findings are forward-looking, none a defect at current scope. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-FSWATCH-REWALK-AMPLIFICATION
- **Files:** `src/components/workspace/RightPanelHost.tsx:162-163`
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (latent scaling cost)
- **Finding:** Each `fs-change` event bumps BOTH `fsTreeRefreshKey` and `gitStatusRefreshKey`, each triggering a full `fs_tree` re-walk + `git_file_statuses` IPC. With the 200ms debounce, a bulk external op (`git checkout`, branch switch) still produces multiple batches → several back-to-back full-tree re-walks. Acceptable at the operator's repo sizes (the `build_ignore` doc-comment already accepts "a harmless extra re-walk"); the only place in the design where event→work amplification is unbounded.
- **Pickup shape:** a trailing-edge coalesce on the consumer side (collapse rapid `fs-change` bumps into one re-walk), OR raise the backend debounce window. Reassess if/when N-workspace concurrent dogfooding shows real cost. Dismiss if the re-walk stays imperceptible.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-FSWATCH-EMIT-FAILURE-INVISIBLE
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/fs_watch/commands.rs:143,161`
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (observability gap)
- **Finding:** Debouncer-callback failures (debounce errors, emit failures) go to `eprintln!` — consistent with the file's "log, don't crash the callback thread" intent and the repo's no-structured-logger posture, BUT a persistent emit failure means the tree/editor silently stop updating, invisible to the operator. The surfaced-error discipline applied to `workspace_watch_start`/`stop` doesn't reach the steady-state emit path.
- **Pickup shape:** low-value unless emit failures are seen in practice — there's no clean IPC channel back from a detached callback thread to surface a toast. Could set a "watcher degraded" flag the next command reads, or emit a one-shot `fs-watch-error` event. Likely dismiss (FSEvents emit failures are vanishingly rare on a healthy local app).

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-FSWATCH-ISDIR-FALSE
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/fs_watch/mod.rs:119`
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** polish (documented-sound edge)
- **Finding:** `is_ignored` always passes `is_dir=false` to `matched_path_or_any_parents`; the doc-comment correctly explains parent-matching covers directory-only patterns (`foo/`). Non-issue for the watcher's actual inputs (every emitted event path is a file or a path under an ignored dir). Noted only because the comment's reasoning is load-bearing; the reviewer checked the matcher edge and found it sound.
- **Pickup shape:** no action needed — effectively a confirmation the edge was reviewed. Dismiss unless a future case feeds bare directory paths through `is_ignored`.

# app-menu-bar — 2026-06-24

1 MAJOR + 2 MINOR from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `f815154` (0 CRITICAL). Reviewer rated the feature well-built, appropriately-scoped, adds zero new behavior, integrates through existing chord predicates. The MAJOR is the one real durability concern: an unguarded cross-language id contract. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-APPMENU-LABEL-ONLY-ID-COMMENT
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/app_menu/mod.rs` (label-only disabled items + the `label_only_ids_are_not_functional` test)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** readability nit
- **Finding:** The label-only disabled items carry ids (`file.save.label`, etc.) that exist only so `is_functional_id` returns false and the negative-space test can enumerate them — they never reach `on_menu_event` (disabled items don't fire). A reader will hunt for where `file.save.label` is dispatched (answer: never). A one-line comment at the test would save the hunt.
- **Pickup shape:** one-line comment. Trivial `/feature-refactor` or opportunistic.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-APPMENU-LISTENER-NOT-EXTRACTED
- **Files:** `src/App.tsx:120-160` (the `menu` listener effect)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** testability (consistent with standing posture)
- **Finding:** The `menu` listener body (id→action mapping, key re-dispatch, the 4 callback branches with the focused-path-ref lookup) lives inline in `App()` — the one piece of menu logic not extracted to a pure testable seam (unlike `menuBridge`). Extracting the action-dispatch (given an action + a small effects object) would let the callback-vs-key branching be unit-tested. LOW priority — consistent with the repo's "runtime-bound listeners are not unit-tested" posture (XtermPane, useWorkspaceStatus); the pure `menuBridge` mapping IS fully tested, which is the higher-value half.
- **Pickup shape:** optional extraction of a pure `dispatchMenuAction(action, effects)` + its unit test. Defer unless the listener grows.

# m3-wp6-frontend-status-indicator — 2026-06-22

1 MAJOR + 2 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `b377a97` (0 CRITICAL). Reviewer rated it well-built — clean pure/runtime/render layering, faithful wire-contract mirror, exemplary dead-code-allow retirement. The one real blemish is a dead snippet/tooltip path. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP6-MINORS
- **Files:** `src/state/useWorkspaceStatus.ts:53-55`
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Findings:**
  1. **`stateFor` re-created every render** (`useWorkspaceStatus.ts:53-55`) — a fresh closure each render, consumed per-workspace in CenterStage. Harmless at N≤1; a `useCallback` keyed on `statusMap` would avoid re-running the lookup chain as the list grows in Phase 2 (multi-workspace).
- **Pickup shape:** trivial `/feature-refactor` nit. Dismiss via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.
- *(Sub-finding #2 — the unfed `last_output_snippet`/`snippet`-prop tooltip path — RESOLVED 2026-06-30 by debt-paydown WP2, which threaded the snippet end-to-end via `snippetFor`. Removed here in sweep #2.)*

# m3-wp3-socket-listener — 2026-06-22

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `4355e00` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated it well-built — lands scope cleanly, advances the codebase, no refactor warranted; honest integration-level test coverage + negative-direction serde guard; every non-obvious decision carries a WHY comment. All polish-tier. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP3-MINORS
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/hook_socket/commands.rs:31-39,58-59,23`; `src-tauri/src/hook_socket/mod.rs:157-158`
- **Priority:** low (all)
- **Status:** pending
- **Findings:**
  1. **`hook_socket_path` carries a hidden mkdir side effect** (`commands.rs:31-39`) — the function reads as "resolve a path" but `create_dir_all`s the app-data dir, and runs ~3×/launch (once via `start_on_launch`, again per `hook_install::resolve_paths` delegation). Idempotent/harmless, but a future caller wanting just the path string inherits a filesystem write. *(Consider splitting a pure `socket_path()` from an `ensure_socket_dir()` if a path-only caller ever appears.)*
  2. **No per-line length cap in the accept-loop** (`mod.rs:157-158`) — `BufReader::lines()` reads each connection line unbounded. The hook is a trusted single-user local writer so not a real DoS surface, but a malformed writer emitting one unbounded line with no newline would buffer without bound on the accept thread. A `take(N)` cap would harden the never-block-CC thread.
  3. **`HOOK_SOCKET_NAME` over-exported** (`commands.rs:23`) — `pub const` but only consumed within this module (the old private `hook_install` copy was deleted in favor of delegating to `hook_socket_path`). Tighten to module-private unless WP4 references the basename directly.
- **Pickup shape:** all three are trivial `/feature-refactor` nits / opportunistic fixes. None changes correctness or the WP4 hand-off contract. Dismiss any via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.

# m3-wp2-hook-install — 2026-06-22

4 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `77d6a6e` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated it well-built and defensively-minded for a dangerous operation (mutating a shared user `settings.json`); standout test suite (real-config shape + byte-exact round-trip + never-wipe-on-parse-failure). No refactor warranted; all cosmetic/opportunistic. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP2-MINORS
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/hook_install/commands.rs:42` + `mod.rs:78`; `src-tauri/resources/claudesk-hook.pl:66`; `src-tauri/src/hook_install/mod.rs:101`; `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:62`
- **Priority:** low (all)
- **Status:** PARTIAL — #4 (stale `sublime_open` "removed at WP8" comment) RESOLVED 2026-06-30 (debt-paydown WP5): the `lib.rs` `sublime_open` registration comment now states the WP8-redefinition permanent-escape-hatch reality (in-app editor primary, Sublime Text stays one-click, `⌘⇧O` dropped) instead of "Transitional — removed at WP8." #2 already PARTIALLY-ADDRESSED (99a48d5). #1 (chmod/invocation mismatch) + #3 (`NotAnObject` coarseness) remain pending (not in the WP5 comment-drift scope — #1 is a behavior decision, #3 an error-variant refactor).
- **Findings:**
  1. **chmod/`/usr/bin/perl` mismatch** — the registered command runs `/usr/bin/perl <script>` (not `<script>` directly), so the `chmod 0o755` in `deploy_hook_script` + the script's shebang are never exercised; the `commands.rs`/`mod.rs:78` comment "CC invokes it directly" is inaccurate. Either drop the chmod (dead effort) or invoke the script directly. *(Mild — keeping chmod is harmless future-proofing if the command form ever changes; pick one and reconcile the comment.)* **— PARTIALLY ADDRESSED 2026-06-22 (commit 99a48d5):** the related "shell-form is fine, paths are app-controlled" assumption was the leading edge of a real word-split bug (spaced app-data path) — now fixed (paths shell-quoted). The chmod-vs-invocation cosmetic mismatch itself remains open (low pri).
  2. **Perl hook write-side blocking (WP3 heads-up)** — `print $sock $line` (claudesk-hook.pl:66) can block if WP3's listener accepts the connection but stalls on read (`Timeout=>1` covers connect, not write). Not a defect in WP2 (no listener exists yet), but the WP3 author must keep the accept-loop draining promptly to preserve the "never block CC" invariant on the write side. Best addressed when WP3 builds the listener.
  3. **`NotAnObject` error-variant coarseness** — three distinct shape failures (root not object, `hooks` not object, an event value not an array) all collapse to one variant (`mod.rs:101`); a malformed `hooks.<event>` array value yields the misleading "root is not a JSON object" message. Opaque-string-to-toast, low impact; a future debugger would be misdirected.
  4. **Stale `sublime_open` comment (pre-existing)** — `lib.rs:62` still reads "Transitional — removed at WP8 once editor parity," contradicting CLAUDE.md's normative "both Sublime launchers KEPT permanently (revised 2026-06-20)." NOT WP2-introduced (inherited), but sits 2 lines above WP2's new registration and is demonstrably wrong against the style guide. Trivial comment fix.
- **Pickup shape:** all four are trivial `/feature-refactor` nits. #2 is best deferred to WP3 (the listener WP). #1, #3, #4 are quick opportunistic fixes. Dismiss any via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.

# wp9-phase1-polish — 2026-06-19

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `91fae7f` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). The feature is well-built; findings are a partial-failure window already triaged elsewhere, a plan/impl drift note, and a missing clarifying comment. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot (MINOR).

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP9-PLAN-IMPL-DRIFT-CCNOTFOUND
- **File:** `workflow/archive/wp9-phase1-polish.md` P1.1 outcome line vs `src-tauri/src/cc_session/mod.rs`
- **Finding:** The Phase-1 observable-outcome text said the not-found case maps to "a friendly `CcError::Spawn` variant/message"; the shipped code introduces a dedicated `CcError::CcNotFound` variant instead (cleaner than overloading `Spawn`).
- **Why it matters:** Pure plan-text/impl drift note — the implementation choice is better than the planned one; recorded only so the divergence is on file. No code change wanted.
- **Suggested action:** None (informational). Resolve by acknowledging the better-than-planned choice.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP9-CLASSIFY-CASEFOLD-COMMENT
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/cc_session/mod.rs` (`classify_spawn_error`)
- **Finding:** The classifier lowercases the raw message then matches lowercase literal markers; a one-line comment noting the `to_lowercase()` is what makes the literals safe (vs the markers being pre-lowered by coincidence) would help a future editor. Existing comment explains liberality but not the case-folding contract.
- **Why it matters:** Readability only; logic is correct.
- **Suggested action:** Add the one-line comment in a future touch of this fn. Trivial.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# wp8-sublime-hotkey — 2026-06-19

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `74dfc2c` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). The feature survived a mid-flight OS-global→in-app spec reversal with no live remnants; findings are all doc-accuracy/cosmetic. MINOR #1 (stale "global-shortcut handler" rationale) was FIXED IN-PLACE at finalize-prep time in both the WIP Discoveries and the backlog SURFACE entry — not pending. The 2 below are the remaining cosmetic nits. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot (MINOR).

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP3-PROBE-SECTION-SHORTHAND
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/sublime/mod.rs:46-47` vs `:99`
- **Finding:** `ST_BUNDLE_BIN`'s doc cites "WP3 probe §Decision point 2" while the module header cites "WP3 T3" for the `--project` finding — inconsistent shorthand for the same archived probe source.
- **Why it matters:** trivial cross-reference polish; a reader can't tell if they're distinct citations. Both point at `workflow/archive/wp3-sublime-cli-probe.md`.
- **Suggested action:** normalize both to one citation style. Trivial.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-CHORD-TS-PHASE-TAG
- **File:** `src/sublime/chord.ts:1`
- **Finding:** Header tagged "WP8 Phase 2" reads oddly standalone now the tree collapsed to 2 phases (Rust core / frontend). Accurate, just stylistically loose.
- **Why it matters:** cosmetic; no functional impact.
- **Suggested action:** drop the "Phase 2" qualifier or leave as-is. Lowest priority.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# wp5-frontend-ui-prototype — 2026-06-18

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `777c0b8` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). All cosmetic stylesheet/intent-clarity nits, zero correctness impact. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-18-QUALITY-WP5-XTERMPANE-EFFECT-DEP
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/XtermPane.tsx:60`
- **Finding:** the xterm mount `useEffect` keys on `[workspaceId]`, but CenterStage uses `key={ws.id}` so a changed id already forces a fresh component instance. `[]` would express once-per-mount intent more honestly.
- **Why it matters:** slight intent-obscuring; a maintainer may think id-change-driven re-mount is a supported path when component identity already guarantees it.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-18-QUALITY-WP5-GLOBAL-H1-RULE
- **File:** `src/components/picker/ProjectPicker.tsx:91` (+ `src/App.css` global `h1`)
- **Finding:** the global `h1 { text-align: center }` rule now has a single consumer (the picker heading); reads as leftover scaffold generality.
- **Why it matters:** trivial; cosmetic clarity of the stylesheet's global section.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m2-wp2-editor-shell — 2026-06-19

2 MAJOR + 3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `a84f3e9` (0 CRITICAL). Feature rated "advances the codebase rather than accruing debt." Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot (MAJOR → Case B, MINOR → low). The two MAJORs are the load-bearing ones (backend root-trust seam + a doc/behavior security-invariant mismatch), both flagged as Phase-2-hardening candidates, neither refactor-blocking.

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-RESOLVE-WITHIN-LEAF-SYMLINK
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/editor_fs/mod.rs:45-90` (`resolve_within`)
- **Finding:** Canonicalizes only the target's *parent* and re-attaches the leaf un-canonicalized; a symlink whose *leaf* points outside the workspace root is NOT rejected (read/write follow it), yet the module doc (lines 17-22, 50-52) claims "a symlink inside root pointing outside is also rejected." Doc overclaims an invariant the code doesn't fully enforce.
- **Why it matters:** A future reader trusts "invariant not convention" and won't re-audit. Low exploitability (single-user local tool, user picks in-project files) but the doc/behavior mismatch is the debt.
- **Suggested action:** Canonicalize the resolved target when it exists and re-check `starts_with(root_canon)`; OR downgrade the doc claim to match. Pairs with the Phase-2 backend-hardening item below.
- **Priority:** medium
- **Status:** PARTIAL (D2, debt-paydown WP5, operator decision 2026-06-30) — DOC downgraded now, HARDENING deferred. The `editor_fs` module header + `resolve_within` doc were narrowed to state the actual guarantee: a non-leaf (directory-component) symlink escaping root IS rejected (parent canonicalize), but a LEAF symlink is NOT followed-and-validated; the over-claim is gone. The actual fix (canonicalize the full target when it exists) stays **Deferred** to a future hardening pass (anchored here), NOT done this sweep.

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-BACKEND-TRUSTS-FRONTEND-ROOT
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/editor_fs/commands.rs:18-26` (`read_file`/`write_file`)
- **Finding:** Both commands take `root: String` straight from the frontend with no app-side derivation, unlike `config_store`'s commands which resolve `app_data_dir()` server-side. The "confined to the open project" guarantee rests entirely on the renderer passing a correct `projectPath` — the trust boundary for the root guard lives in the webview, not the backend.
- **Why it matters:** Phase 2 (multi-workspace) multiplies the IPC callers and surface; this is the seam to tighten before more callers depend on it. Acceptable for the single-user PoC today.
- **Suggested action:** Consider having the backend validate `root` against the known project list (config_store) before honoring it, so a malformed/hostile root can't widen the guard. Pairs with the leaf-symlink item above (same module, same Phase-2 hardening pass).
- **Priority:** medium
- **Status:** PARTIAL (D2, debt-paydown WP5, operator decision 2026-06-30) — DOC stated now, HARDENING deferred. The `editor_fs/commands.rs` module doc now explicitly says `root` is frontend-supplied/-trusted (not re-validated against config_store) — acceptable for the single-user local editor where the frontend shares the trust boundary; the guard's job is to confine the *file path* to `root`, not authenticate `root`. The actual validate-`root`-against-config_store hardening stays **Deferred** to a future pass (anchored here, pairs with the leaf-symlink item above).

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-SAVEKEYMAP-CHURN
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/EditorPanel.tsx:73-87`
- **Finding:** `doSave` depends on `save.kind` (to enable retry-after-error) → rebuilds `saveKeymap` → reconfigures the CM6 view on every save-status transition. Functionally correct (WP1 confirmed reconfigure-on-identity-change works) but the status-driven keymap churn is a non-obvious cost.
- **Suggested action:** Add a short comment, or decouple the retry path so `doSave`'s identity doesn't depend on save status. Low effort.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-EDITORLOAD-UNDERSCORE-PARAM
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/editorLoad.ts:24`
- **Finding:** Reducer parameter named `_state` (underscore signals "unused") but it IS used in the `default` branch (`return _state`); `editorSave.ts:26` correctly names the same param `state`. Inconsistent within the same feature.
- **Suggested action:** Rename `_state` → `state` in `editorLoad.ts`.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-19-QUALITY-WP2-LANGUAGE-TEST-SPECULATIVE-COMMENT
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/__tests__/language.test.ts:73`
- **Finding:** Test comment "json ... not wired yet (WP3 may add)" — speculative forward-guess that ages into noise.
- **Suggested action:** Drop the parenthetical; the assertion (json → plaintext) stands on its own.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m2-wp3a-editor-core-editing — 2026-06-20

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `59cc324` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). The feature is well-built and low-debt; findings are cosmetic comment-triplication and a benign self-flagged double-bind. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot (MINOR).

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP3A-MOD-D-DOUBLE-BIND
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/editorExtensions.ts:92,125`
- **Finding:** `Mod-d` (`selectNextOccurrence`) is bound explicitly at `Prec.highest` AND is also present in the spread `...searchKeymap`, so the binding appears twice in the same keymap.
- **Why it matters:** CM6 resolves first-match-wins so behavior is correct; the author flagged it in-line as intentional belt-and-suspenders. Mild dead weight only.
- **Suggested action:** Optionally drop the explicit `Mod-d` line (rely on searchKeymap) OR keep with the existing comment. Trivial.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP3A-MOD-R-COMMENT-OVERSELL
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/editorExtensions.ts:97`
- **Finding:** `Mod-r` runs `openSearchPanel`, which opens the same panel as Cmd+F (the replace row is visible by default). The comment frames it as "the replace chord," slightly overselling a functional distinction from find.
- **Why it matters:** Behavior satisfies the operator's intent (replace fields present), but the comment could mislead a future reader into thinking Cmd+R does something Cmd+F doesn't. Trivial.
- **Suggested action:** Soften the comment, or add `replace`-focus behavior if a real distinction is wanted later.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m2-wp3c-editor-split-panes — 2026-06-20

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `b72ed30` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated the feature well-built, low-debt, fitting the codebase grain (pure minimal pane reducer, panel-level shared-document boundary respected end-to-end, proportionate tests asserting reference identity for no-ops). All three are cosmetic comment/duplication nits. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP3C-MIDDLE-CLOSE-INDEX-COMMENT
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/editorPanes.ts:69-72` (the `close` focus-reassign)
- **Finding:** The middle-close focus-reassign `panes[Math.min(idx, panes.length - 1)]` is correct and tested, but relies on `idx` being the PRE-filter index while `panes` is the POST-filter array — so after filtering, `idx` points at the element that slid up into the closed slot. The current comment ("prefer the pane that took its slot") states the intent but not the index-shift mechanism.
- **Why it matters:** the off-by-one surface here is exactly where a future edit could silently break focus reassignment; the test guards the behavior but not the reasoning. A one-line comment naming the index-shift assumption lowers future-reader cost.
- **Suggested action:** Add a one-line comment: "idx is the pre-filter index; after filtering it points at the element that slid up into the closed slot." No code change.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP3C-REDUNDANT-JSX-COMMENT
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/editor/EditorPanel.tsx:295` (the `.editor-panes` inline comment)
- **Finding:** The inline JSX comment restates the shared-doc rationale ("vertical stack of panes… each pane is a viewport onto the shared doc") that is already stated authoritatively in the file header and in `editorPanes.ts` — WHAT-not-WHY redundancy.
- **Why it matters:** minor comment redundancy; the canonical explanation lives in two better places.
- **Suggested action:** Trim the inline comment to a brief pointer or drop it. No code change.
- **Priority:** low

# m2-wp4-git-diff-viewer — 2026-06-20

4 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `4e2d742` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer verdict: well-built, advances the codebase, no refactor warranted. Findings are doc-comment drift left by the PB.7 removal sweep (2) + dead diff-option config (1) + a frontend clarity nit (1). All low priority. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP4-DEAD-UNTRACKED-OPTS-STAGED
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/git_diff/mod.rs:338-344` (`file_hunks_core` DiffOptions)
- **Finding:** `include_untracked`/`recurse_untracked_dirs`/`show_untracked_content` are set on the shared `opts` used by both branches, but they're only meaningful on the unstaged `diff_index_to_workdir` path — the staged `diff_tree_to_index` branch can never see an untracked file. Harmless dead config on the staged path.
- **Why it matters:** minor confusion cost; the shared-`opts` construction obscures that the two branches want different options.
- **Suggested action:** build the untracked options only on the unstaged branch (or note inline that they're no-ops on the staged path).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP4-COMMIT-DIFF-GATE-TERNARIES
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/diff/DiffPanel.tsx:368-379` (commit-diff render gate)
- **Finding:** the "is this commit diff for the currently-selected commit?" gate is 3 sibling JSX ternaries (`commitDiff?.sha === selectedSha` / `!== selectedSha` + error branch) over the same two values.
- **Why it matters:** low-effort clarity win in the one part of the component with non-obvious async-staleness handling.
- **Suggested action:** derive a single `commitReady`/`commitStale` flag above the return; collapse the three branches to loading-vs-loaded-vs-error.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m2-wp4-diff-viewer-polish — 2026-06-20

Reviewer (code-quality-reviewer on ship commit 5051bd4): 0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR, 3 MINOR. Verdict: well-built, appropriately-scoped polish; no refactor warranted. All three are micro-readability / posture notes.

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP4POLISH-DOUBLE-PREDICATE
- **Source:** feature:review-quality (m2-wp4-diff-viewer-polish)
- **Type:** tech-debt
- **Summary:** In `DiffPanel.tsx` `toggleAllCollapsed`, `allCollapsed(prev, visibleKeys)` is recomputed inside the setter while `everyCollapsed` already holds an independent evaluation of the same predicate one line above. Both correct (the setter must read fresh `prev`), but the two call sites could drift if someone edits one predicate.
- **Suggested action:** Optional — leave as-is (the in-setter fresh-`prev` read is intentional), or add a one-line comment noting the deliberate duplication.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP4POLISH-USEMEMO-DEP
- **Source:** feature:review-quality (m2-wp4-diff-viewer-polish)
- **Type:** tech-debt
- **Summary:** `visibleKeys` useMemo deps on the whole `list` reducer state object rather than `list.kind`/`list.files`. Correct (listReducer returns a new object per dispatch) but re-derives on list-state transitions (idle→loading) that don't change the key set.
- **Suggested action:** Optional micro-opt — narrow the dep to `list.kind` + `list.files`. Negligible perf impact.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP4POLISH-STICKY-ZINDEX-COUPLING
- **Source:** feature:review-quality (m2-wp4-diff-viewer-polish)
- **Type:** tech-debt
- **Summary:** The whole-commits-sticky layout relies on z-index ordering (2 vs 2 vs 1) across `.diff-commits` / `.diff-commit-banner` / `.diff-file-header`, all pinning at `top:0` in `.diff-scroll`. No mechanical guard (no CSS/visual-regression harness per repo posture) — a future top/z-index edit could silently restack. Comments document the coupling.
- **Context:** Inherent to UI polish in a repo whose posture is pure-fn vitest + live operator verify-human; not a defect, a fragility note.
- **Suggested action:** None required. If a visual-regression harness is ever added (Phase 4 polish?), pin this invariant.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m2-wp5-right-panel-host — 2026-06-20

1 MAJOR + 2 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `4546ffb` (0 CRITICAL). Reviewer: well-built refactor-plus-feature — faithful Workspace→RightPanelHost extraction, root-cause item-7 resolver fix with targeted regression guards, standout cross-predicate chord-exclusivity test, above-average chord-ownership doc discipline. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP5-SPLIT-LISTENER-CROSSPOINTER
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/RightPanelHost.tsx:30-36` (document+capture, ⌘⇧E/D/T) vs `src/components/workspace/SublimeToolbar.tsx:35-45` (window+bubble, ⌘⇧O)
- **Finding:** Two separate keydown listeners now exist per visible workspace with split chord-ownership (host owns the panel chords on document+capture; toolbar owns the Sublime-Text pop on window+bubble). Functionally disjoint by chord letter (no conflict — confirmed), but the partition is only discoverable by reading both files.
- **Why it matters:** low-cost clarity for a deliberately partitioned listener set; a maintainer touching one may not realize the other exists.
- **Suggested action:** a one-line comment in RightPanelHost noting "SublimeToolbar owns ⌘⇧O separately (window+bubble)". Trivial `/feature-refactor` nit.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m2-wp6-file-finder — 2026-06-20

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `fc77ad4` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). The feature is well-built and low-debt — reviewer validated correctness (deterministic tiebreak sort, greedy subsequence matcher, async cancellation, chord exclusivity) and consistency with repo seams. All three are minor overlay/doc nits. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP6-PANEL-CHORD-UNDER-OVERLAY
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/RightPanelHost.tsx:60-75` (the capture-phase keydown listener)
- **Finding:** While the Cmd+P finder overlay is open, a panel chord (⌘⇧E/⌘⇧D) still fires and switches the right-half panel *underneath* the still-visible overlay — the listener doesn't early-return on `finderOpen`.
- **Why it matters:** UX seam, not a correctness bug; a future reader will wonder whether interleaving panel-switch with an open overlay was intended.
- **Suggested action:** Guard panel chords on `!finderOpen` (or add a one-line note that the interleave is acceptable). Trivial.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP6-DOT-BOUNDARY-RATIONALE
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/finder/fuzzyMatch.ts:32-34` (`isBoundary`)
- **Finding:** `isBoundary` includes `.`, so the char after an extension dot earns the +8 segment-boundary bonus (e.g. `m` in `file.md`). Harmless given the "deliberately simple" ranker and current tests, but why `.` is a boundary is undocumented.
- **Why it matters:** the dot-boundary is the least obvious of the four boundary chars; a half-line of rationale would prevent a future reader second-guessing it.
- **Suggested action:** Add a one-line comment explaining the `.` inclusion (matches extension chars after a dot), or drop `.` if it ever distorts ordering. No correctness impact now.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-20-QUALITY-WP6-HOVER-COUPLES-KEYBOARD-CURSOR
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/finder/FileFinder.tsx:177` (`onMouseEnter`)
- **Finding:** `onMouseEnter={() => setActiveIndex(i)}` couples mouse-hover to the keyboard cursor — a mouse resting over the list can yank the active row out from under an arrow-key user.
- **Why it matters:** minor interaction nit; negligible at the 100-row cap. Mirrors the same pattern in CommandPalette (consistency), so arguably WAI.
- **Suggested action:** Optionally gate the hover-set on actual pointer movement, or leave (matches CommandPalette). Low value.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m3-wp4-status-broadcaster — 2026-06-22

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `8bc2d68` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated it well-built — textbook "pure core, thin runtime shell"; every piece of logic unit-tested, the one IO-bound line (`app.emit`) isolated and acknowledged, the end-to-end test exercising real WP3 socket plumbing through the transform without a Tauri app. Honors the load-bearing conventions; documents the item-scoped-allow deviation. No refactor warranted; all cosmetic docstring drift. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP4-MINORS
- **Files:** `src-tauri/src/status_broadcaster/commands.rs:41-47,48-53`
- **Priority:** low (all)
- **Status:** PARTIAL — #1 RESOLVED 2026-06-30 (debt-paydown WP5); #2 (`.expect` convention judgment) DISMISSED (WP3's `spawn_listener` `.expect` precedent is the accepted house style for infallible thread spawns); #3 (detached-handle WHY) folded into #1's rewrite (the new doc states there's no error channel + the guard lives at the lib.rs call site — the "may hold or detach" framing is gone).
- **Findings:**
  1. **`start_broadcaster` docstring describes a `Result`-style error contract the signature lacks** (`commands.rs:43-47`) — the doc says "errors returned as a human-readable string for the caller to surface… the only failure here is the receiver already having been taken," but the function returns `thread::JoinHandle<()>` with no error channel, and the double-start (receiver-already-taken) guard actually lives in `lib.rs`. The prose has drifted from the signature + call site. *(Fix: trim the docstring to match — the spawn either succeeds or panics via `.expect`; the receiver-take guard is documented at the lib.rs call site.)* — **RESOLVED 2026-06-30 (WP5):** trimmed the docstring to "no error channel: the spawn either succeeds or panics via `.expect`; the double-start guard (the `Receiver` can only be taken once) lives at the `lib.rs` call site."
  2. **`.expect()` on the thread spawn is a non-test panic path** (`commands.rs:48-53`) — `Builder::spawn(...).expect(...)` violates the "no unwrap outside tests" convention, though it mirrors WP3's `spawn_listener` precedent (`hook_socket/mod.rs`) and thread-spawn failure is near-impossible in practice. Borderline; flagged for convention-consistency only. *(If WP3's pattern is accepted as the house style for infallible thread spawns, dismiss.)*
  3. **Detached-handle asymmetry is undocumented** (`commands.rs:41-42`) — the docstring says the caller "may hold or detach" the `JoinHandle`, and `lib.rs` discards it (detached) while WP3's listener retains `_handle` in `HookSocketState`. The asymmetry is correct (the drain thread self-terminates on channel close, so no cleanup handle is needed) but the WHY is unstated. *(Fix: one-line note "detached — exits on channel close, no cleanup needed.")*
- **Pickup shape:** all three are trivial `/feature-refactor` doc-fix nits in one file; none changes correctness, the emit behavior, or any hand-off contract. Items 1 + 3 are pure docstring corrections; item 2 is a convention judgment call (dismiss if WP3's `.expect` precedent stands). Dismiss any via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.

# m4-wp1-n-workspace-cost-probe — 2026-06-22

2 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `9f3e0fe` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated it well-built — measures the real production tree, isolates the new unknown from the incidental backend-RAM surprise, effectively zero durable debt (the only lasting change is a one-branch dispatcher; the rest is throwaway probe code archived at finalize). Both findings are robustness/precision nits in the throwaway `measure.sh`. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP1-MEASURE-PGREP-GUARD-DEGRADED
- **Files:** `src/probe/nworkspaces/measure.sh:33-34`
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (throwaway-code robustness)
- **Summary:** The `pgrep -fc 'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'` N-alive sanity guard printed `?` during the actual measurement run (a shell-snapshot eval-mangling artifact of the literal pattern), so the script's one built-in "did N actually spawn?" guard silently degraded; the operator fell back to a manual `pgrep -fl` to confirm 8 live sessions.
- **Context:** The guard exists precisely so an N-workspace probe doesn't silently measure 1 live session instead of N. It didn't fail the measurement (the operator caught it), but the guard as written wasn't robust to the run environment. Throwaway probe code — slated for deletion-or-archival at finalize.
- **Suggested action:** If the probe is ever re-run (rather than archived), make the count robust — e.g. capture PIDs into a var first (`pids=$(pgrep -f dangerously-skip-permissions); echo "$pids" | grep -c .`) rather than `pgrep -fc` with a pattern that the eval wrapper can mangle. Likely moot once the probe is archived.
- **Pickup shape:** trivial; only relevant if the probe is resurrected. Dismiss via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.

## SURFACE-2026-06-22-QUALITY-WP1-MEASURE-PERCENTILE-OFFBYONE
- **Files:** `src/probe/nworkspaces/measure.sh:75` (also the same in `src/probe/cm6/measure.sh`)
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
- **Type:** tech-debt (precision nit, inherited from baseline)
- **Summary:** Percentile indexing `a[int(n*0.5)]` / `a[int(n*0.95)]` is the lower-median truncation, not interpolated — a classic off-by-one vs a 1-based interpolated percentile. Copied verbatim from `cm6/measure.sh`.
- **Context:** With 110+ samples the error is sub-sample and immaterial to a threshold (<20%) decision, and matching the established `cm6/measure.sh` baseline is the right call for cross-probe comparability. Flagged for completeness only.
- **Suggested action:** None recommended (matching the baseline is intentional). If a future probe wants exact percentiles, fix both `measure.sh` copies together. Throwaway code.
- **Pickup shape:** no action; informational. Dismiss via the WIP's `## Code-Quality Review` section.

# m4-wp2-n1-lift — 2026-06-23

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `b48ccce` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated it well-built + scope-disciplined; the `kill_all` parallelization was the standout (sound ownership reasoning + deterministic timing test). All 3 are low-effort polish in the new picker-overlay code. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP2-OVERLAY-ESC-PREVENTDEFAULT
- **File:** `src/components/picker/PickerOverlay.tsx:28-37`
- **Finding:** the document-level Esc handler calls `preventDefault()` unconditionally → suppresses the picker search input's native Esc-to-clear, and is a latent conflict if another document Esc consumer (command palette / finder share the `command-palette-backdrop` shell) is ever co-mounted.
- **Suggested action:** scope the Esc handling (only preventDefault when the overlay is the topmost consumer, or only when Esc isn't being used to clear the focused input).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP2-TOAST-SINGLE-SLOT-MULTIPLEX
- **File:** `src/components/picker/ProjectPicker.tsx:131-149`
- **Finding:** the single `toast` slot multiplexes two independent signals (benign `info` prune-note vs surfaced `error` IPC failure) — a transient prune note can be clobbered the instant a mutation fails (or vice versa).
- **Suggested action:** if it bites, split into separate info/error slots (or a small queue). Acceptable for WP2 scope.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m4-wp3-filmstrip — 2026-06-23

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship `920678a`.

## SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP3-OFFVIEWPORT-A11Y
- **Finding:** `Workspace.tsx:56-78` — the P1.2 `display:none` → `position:absolute; left:-99999px` switch leaves background workspaces (full editor + live PTY) in the tab order + accessibility tree (display:none had removed them). No `inert`/`aria-hidden` on the non-`visible` branch → keyboard focus can land in an off-screen workspace; screen readers announce N hidden terminals.
- **Suggested fix:** add `inert` to the hidden branch (doesn't affect FitAddon/serialize, doesn't change layout).
- **Priority:** low (genuine minor a11y/focus regression; low-effort)
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP3-TICKER-EFFECT-DUAL-RESPONSIBILITY
- **Finding:** `Filmstrip.tsx:113-126` — the active-tile stale-mirror clear shares the ticker `useEffect` (two responsibilities; a future ticker-dep edit could shift clear timing). Works + commented.
- **Suggested fix:** split the clear into its own effect keyed on `activeId`.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m4-wp4-filmstrip-collapse — 2026-06-23

2 actionable MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship `d06ac50`. Reviewer rated it well-built — idiomatic pure-helper extraction, correct effect lifecycle, dark-only CSS honored, no debt accrued. (A 3rd "finding" was a non-actionable test-count-consistency confirmation, not logged.)

## SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP4-ACTIVE-PILL-NOOP-PROMOTE
- **Finding:** `Filmstrip.tsx` collapsed branch — the pill row maps over ALL tiles including the active one and gives the active pill `onClick={() => onPromote(tile.id)}`, a silent no-op (focusWorkspace on the already-focused workspace), while still advertising `aria-label="Switch to <name>"` + a pointer cursor. The expanded tiles avoid a click handler on the active tile (promote flows through the strip pointer-up path).
- **Suggested fix:** no-op guard on the active pill (skip onPromote when `tile.active`) or an `aria-current`-aware disabled affordance, to align the two render branches.
- **Priority:** low (minor UX/a11y inconsistency between branches; harmless functionally)
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP4-BGIDS-JOIN-SPLIT-ROUNDTRIP
- **Finding:** `Filmstrip.tsx` ticker effect — `bgSignature ? bgSignature.split(",") : []` re-derives `backgroundIds` by splitting a comma-joined string that was just built from `tiles.filter(...).map(...)` a few lines above. The same id array could be memoized once and reused for both the signature and the iteration.
- **Suggested fix:** compute the background-id array once; derive `bgSignature` from it (join) for the dep, and reuse the array for iteration.
- **Priority:** low (trivial readability; join-then-split is a tiny confabulation surface only if an id ever held a comma — not the case today, ids are uuids)
- **Status:** pending
- **Note:** the still-pending `SURFACE-2026-06-23-QUALITY-WP3-TICKER-EFFECT-DUAL-RESPONSIBILITY` is in this same ticker effect — WP4 added the `shouldRunMirror` gate but did not split the active-tile clear. The two are natural pickup-together candidates for one `/feature-refactor` pass on the ticker effect.

# dev-prod-isolation — 2026-06-24

3 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `5f9a86a` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated the feature well-built and advancing the codebase: single-root-cause design (identifier is the one source of truth), exemplary pure/impure split mirroring the config_store/hook_install precedent, the substring trap closed with exact-match + a both-directions regression test, and WHY-encoding doc comments. All three findings are low-risk coupling/drift seams, none affecting correctness. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-DEVPROD-BASENAME-SPACE-ASSUMPTION
- **File:** `src-tauri/src/hook_install/mod.rs:84-90`
- **Finding (MINOR):** `script_basename_of_command` matches the last whitespace token ending in `.pl` (after quote-stripping). Correct for all command shapes Claudesk emits and for the real macOS `/Application Support/…` path (the `.pl` tail token survives the split), but it assumes no `.pl`-suffixed path *segment* contains a space. Inputs are app-controlled → defensive-only.
- **Fix shape:** add a one-line comment documenting the no-spaces-in-`.pl`-segments assumption for any future reuser. Optional.

## SURFACE-2026-06-24-QUALITY-DEVPROD-OVERLAY-WINDOW-SIZE-COUPLING
- **File:** `src-tauri/tauri.dev.json:6-12`
- **Finding (MINOR):** the dev overlay re-declares `width`/`height` in `app.windows[0]` only because Tauri's array-merge replaces the whole window object (the sole intended override is `title`). Documented in the WIP (P1.1) but not at the file site → a future editor changing the prod window size would see dev silently keep 1280×800.
- **Fix shape:** add an inline comment in tauri.dev.json noting the array-replace coupling, or track window size in a shared place. Optional.

# qol-wp6-new-workspace-hotkey — 2026-06-25

2 MINOR findings from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `47fdeb9` (0 CRITICAL, 0 MAJOR). Reviewer rated the feature clean and convention-adherent — pure-predicate + app-level-listener split is the right factoring, disjointness vs the neighbouring ⌘N chord is bidirectionally documented, the listener is a near-verbatim clone of the proven ⌘⇧+digit effect. Accrues no debt. Both findings are low-effort honesty/hygiene nits, neither a behavior bug. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-25-QUALITY-WP6-CHORD-MAP-XREF-HYGIENE
- **File:** `src/components/workspace/newWorkspaceChord.ts:6`
- **Finding (MINOR):** header cites "the chord-ownership map in editor/paletteCommands.ts" (same citation as sibling `workspaceSwitchChord.ts`) — a cross-reference that drifts silently if the map ever moves/renames. Confirmed present + correct this session, so no action needed today; flagged only as cross-reference hygiene for a future map-relocation.
- **Fix shape:** if the chord-ownership map is ever relocated, grep for "paletteCommands.ts" and update all chord-file headers together. No standalone fix.
- **Priority:** low (cross-reference hygiene; not a confirmed break).
- **Status:** pending

# m5-wp2-probe-agent-ui-driver — 2026-06-26

3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `f18f1e0`. Knowledge-producing probe (VERDICT: ADOPT); minimal executable footprint (dev-only bridge wiring), correctly release-gated three ways. Reviewer verdict: well-built, every non-obvious trap documented at its site, no refactor warranted. Priority: low (all). Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-26-QUALITY-WP2-LINGERING-ALLOW-UNUSED-MUT
- **Finding:** The dev-only bridge block mutates `builder` after the initial `.plugin(...)` chain, requiring `#[allow(unused_mut)] let mut builder`. Correct idiom for conditional plugin registration, but the `#[allow(unused_mut)]` masks the release-build case where `builder` is never reassigned — a small latent lint-suppression.
- **Where:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:65-72` (approx; the `let mut builder` restructure).
- **Fix shape:** no action needed while the bridge stays dev-only-conditional; if WP2 wiring is ever torn down or made unconditional, drop the `#[allow]` rather than let it linger. Track-only.
- **Priority:** low

# m5-wp3-pip-nspanel-status-core — 2026-06-26

2 MAJOR + 3 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `95292d6`. Reviewer verdict: well-built, advances the codebase more than it accrues debt; the 2 MAJOR are NOT bugs at the shipped baseline (both benign on WP3's only lifecycle path) but are latent desyncs the **M5 WP5 lifecycle work will trip over** — carry into WP5 scope, not a standalone refactor. Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-26-QUALITY-WP3-UNDIFFED-MIRROR-EMIT
- **Finding:** The `pip-mirror` emit sends `mirrorFrameSnapshot()` — the full serialized HTML for every needed workspace — every tick while shown, no per-tile diffing. Correct at dogfood N; worth a comment noting it's intentionally un-diffed.
- **Where:** `src/components/workspace/useMirrorTicker.ts` (~130, the emit).
- **Fix shape:** add `// full-frame each tick — no diff; revisit if N grows` (WP4/WP5 scaling territory). Optionally diff if N grows.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# m5-wp4-pip-layout-modes-switcher-resize — 2026-06-26

4 MINOR findings (0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR) from `feature-review-quality` on ship commit `d38a191`. Reviewer verdict: well-built, high-discipline, negligible debt — all four are comment/vestige drift, none affecting correctness. Priority: low (all). Auto-backlogged per drive_mode=autopilot.

## SURFACE-2026-06-26-QUALITY-WP4-DRAG-CLICK-BOUNDARY-IMPLICIT
- **Finding:** `startPanelDrag` registers window mousemove/up listeners + calls preventDefault even on a zero-distance click (one that never moves); benign because mouseup always fires + cleans up, but the click-vs-drag arbitration on the switch row is implicit.
- **Why it matters:** minor clarity; a reader can't tell at a glance why a click on the row's empty space is safe.
- **Suggested action:** add a one-line comment at the listener registration noting "zero-distance click = no pip_move sent (dx==dy==0 guard); mouseup always cleans up".
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

# wp3-split-ratio-control — 2026-06-27

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 0b68f5a; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 4 MINOR. Reviewer: well-built, low-debt; no refactor warranted — all 4 are prose/comment-accuracy nits.)*

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP3-APP-GLOBAL-STATE-PROSE
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `splitState` is app-global-PERSISTED (one localStorage key) but held in per-Workspace `useState`, so each mounted workspace keeps its own live copy — cross-workspace sync is by remount, not shared live state. The commit + docstrings call it "app-global (shared by all workspaces)," slightly overstating live sharing. (Matches the file-tree rail's model; functionally fine for the single-window switch-on-display pattern.)
- **Suggested action:** one-line comment in Workspace.tsx clarifying "each workspace mirrors the shared key; live sync is by remount, not cross-instance."
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP3-EFFECTIVERAIL-DOCSTRING-GUARANTEES
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `effectiveRailWidth` docstring claims both "never below RAIL_MIN" and "never above the stored width"; these can conflict in principle if stored < RAIL_MIN (unreachable today because clampRailWidth guarantees stored ≥ RAIL_MIN). The min-wins resolution is undocumented. Not a bug.
- **Suggested action:** note in the docstring that the function relies on the caller's clampRailWidth invariant (stored ≥ RAIL_MIN), and that `Math.min` resolves the edge safely.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP3-REFIT-NUDGE-LEFT-ONLY-ASYMMETRY
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** the un-collapse refit nudge fires only on the left (CC) edge (`[leftCollapsed]`); the right half relies on RightPanelHost's own ResizeObserver. Reasonable (only the xterm pane has the WKWebView display-flip fit fragility) but the asymmetry isn't called out.
- **Suggested action:** half-sentence comment: "right half needs no nudge — only xterm's FitAddon has the display-flip race."
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP3-INTRA-FEATURE-PHASE-COMMENTS
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** several comments (App.css split-control block, Workspace.tsx, splitWidth.ts) reference "Phase 1 / Phase 2" of the build sequence; in the merged single commit these describe history, not pending work, and could read as latent/unshipped to a future reader.
- **Suggested action:** reword the intra-feature phase references to describe the shipped behavior rather than the build order (or drop the phase labels).
- **Priority:** low

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP2-LONGEST-PREFIX-STRLEN-PROXY
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `resolve_cwd`'s longest-wins (`mod.rs:242-245`) uses `max_by_key(registered.len())` — string-length as a proxy for path-component depth. Correct in practice (candidates are pre-filtered to true ancestors of one cwd, so they're prefixes of each other), but a future reader may second-guess the string-length proxy sitting two lines below the component-safe `is_path_ancestor`.
- **Suggested action:** consider `Path::components().count()` for semantic consistency with `is_path_ancestor`, removing the proxy-reasoning footnote.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-27-QUALITY-WP2-RESOLVE-CWD-LINEAR-SCAN
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `resolve_cwd` (`mod.rs:239-246`) now scans all registered entries (`O(n)`) instead of the previous `O(1)` HashMap lookup. Negligible at the documented scale (≤100 workspaces, one CC hook event at a time) — flagged only so the linear scan is a recorded, conscious tradeoff rather than silent drift.
- **Suggested action:** none now; revisit only if a high-frequency event source is ever added that would inherit the scan.
- **Priority:** low

# wp9-suppress-empty-pip — 2026-06-28

*(feature-review-quality on ship commit 7b36853; Mode 3 autopilot auto-backlog. 0 CRITICAL / 0 MAJOR / 2 MINOR. Reviewer: "well-built, low-risk polish that does exactly what its plan said... the two nits are backlog-or-dismiss at most; no refactor warranted.")*

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP9-REDUNDANT-MODE-REREAD
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `pip_set_mode(On)` (`pip/commands.rs`) persists `mode` to disk, then routes to `reconcile_on_mode_visibility`, which re-reads the mode back from disk (`resolve_data_dir` → `read_pip_mode`) rather than using the `mode` already in scope — a redundant disk read on a user-click path. Harmless (the read returns the just-persisted value) and arguably consistent with the file's "read fresh from the persisted source of truth" discipline used by the focus handler.
- **Fix shape:** either pass the in-hand `mode` into a count-only reconcile variant, or add a one-line comment noting the re-read is the deliberate "fresh from persisted truth" pattern. Lean: a comment, unless the hot-path read ever shows up.
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending

## SURFACE-2026-06-28-QUALITY-WP9-LEN-WITHOUT-IS-EMPTY
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Finding:** `WorkspaceRegistry::len()` (`status_broadcaster/mod.rs`) was un-gated from `#[cfg(test)]` to gain a runtime caller without a companion `is_empty()`. Clippy-clean here (`len_without_is_empty` does not fire) and deliberate (an `is_empty()` was added then removed as dead code) — flagged only so a future reader who expects the idiomatic `len`/`is_empty` pair knows the omission was intentional.
- **Suggested action:** none now; add `is_empty()` only if/when a caller needs it (clippy will then require the pair).
- **Priority:** low
- **Status:** pending
